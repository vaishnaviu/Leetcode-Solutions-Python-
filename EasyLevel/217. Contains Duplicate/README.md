# Intuition
The problem is to determine whether there are any duplicate elements in the given list of integers. We can use a set to keep track of unique elements and check for duplicates.

# Approach
We will iterate through the input list of numbers. For each number, we will check if it is already in the set of unique numbers. If it is, then we have found a duplicate, and we return True. If not, we add the number to the set. If we finish iterating through the list without finding any duplicates, we return False.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the input list.
- Space complexity: \(O(n)\) for the set to store unique numbers.
