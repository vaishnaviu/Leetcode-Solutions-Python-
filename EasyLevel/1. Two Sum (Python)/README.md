# Intuition
The intuition behind this approach is to use a hash map to store the indices of elements as we traverse the list. This way, we can efficiently check if the complement of the current element (i.e., target - nums[i]) exists in the hash map.

# Approach
We use a hash map to store the indices of elements as we traverse the list. For each element `nums[i]`, we calculate the complement (target - nums[i]) and check if it exists in the hash map. If it does, we return the indices of the two elements that sum to the target. If not, we store the current element and its index in the hash map to be used for future checks.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n) - We traverse the list once, and each lookup in the hash map takes constant time.
- Space complexity: O(n) - The space used by the hash map is proportional to the number of elements in the list.

In the `twoSum` function, we iterate through the elements of the `nums` list. For each element, we calculate its complement (the value we need to achieve the target). If the complement is already in the hash map (indicating that we've seen it before), we return the indices of the two elements. If the complement is not in the hash map, we store the current element and its index for future reference. If no solution is found, we return an empty list.
