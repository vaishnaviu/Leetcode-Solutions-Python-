# Intuition
The problem is to find the maximum subarray sum in the given list of integers. Initially, we need to set the current sum and maximum sum to the first element of the array. We iterate through the array, updating the current sum and the maximum sum as we go.

# Approach
We use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum. We iterate through the array, keeping track of the current sum which is the maximum of the current element and the sum of the previous elements including the current element. We also keep track of the maximum sum encountered so far.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n) where \(n\) is the length of the input list.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
